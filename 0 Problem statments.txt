1. Sorting Objects based on keys:
    - Basic sorting using quick sort on name key of object
    - Time Complexity: O(n log n)
    
    TO ADD:
    - Handle duplicate name values and then sort on id values
    
2. Print all prime numbers from 1 to 100:
    - Prints all prime numbers based on logic that they are not multiple of any numbers except 1 and itself.
    - Time Complexity : O(n)
    
    TO ADD:
    - Single function to check whather a number if prime or not based on different theorms eg: Fermet's theorem, etc

3. Curring function for multipilcation:
    - Curring : It is a process of turning a function with multiple arity into a function with less arity (number of arguments        a function takes).
    - Based on logic that functions in JS are 1st order objects i.e, they can be assigned to a variable, given as a function         argument and also returned from a function.

4. Check Anagram strings:
    - An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word, typically using all the original         letters exactly once.
    - Based on logic: When 2 strings have same number of letters then their sorted alphabets will be in same order
    
    TO ADD:
    - Different ways of implenetation: Using sets, maps

5. Reverse each word of string and capitize first word
6. Fibonnacci series:
   - Impleneted using generator to calculate index of array of fibonacci series 
 
7. Iterate object and find a perticular key from it

8. Inheritance in JS. Explained main 3 types: pseudo-classical inheritance, Prototyple inhertance and Class inheritance

9. Getter Setter methods in JS classes

10. Create a function that splits an array (first argument) into the number of groups equal to the length of size (second         argument) and returns them as a two-dimensional array.

11. Using the 'Caesar cipher' encryption technique write a function to encrypt the string passed as an argument along with          offset.

12. Implement Binary search algorithm in javascript

13. Write a partial function with 3 params and return multipication of them
    Partial function: A function that accepts some subset of its arguments and returns a function that accepts the remaining       arguments. One way to accomplish this is by currying.

14. Using regex, find number of vowels in the string passed as the parameter.

15. Write a deepCopy function that takes a nested object as the parameter and returns a deep copy of the object including         every nested property.

16. Function that generates a random even number every second.

17. Fisher-Yaters Shuffle:
    -The Fisher–Yates shuffle is an algorithm for generating a random permutation of a finite sequence—in plain terms, the          algorithm shuffles the sequence.
    
18. Climbing staircase:
    - Print number of ways a staircase with n can reach to top with steps possible with [a,b,c...] number of steps
    
    TO DO:
    - Steps array should be sorted
    - Need 1 as a step in the array as minimum step
   
19. Print all permutations of array elements provided

20. Function to return the length of the longest common subsequence of two strings.

21. Create a CURD operation with help of closure.

22. Sort array of object based on dates and group them.
        For today and yesterday's data - Group label should be "Recent"
        For Current week data excluding today and yesterday -  Group label should be "This week".
        For Current Month data excluding current week -   Group label should be "This Month"
        For Current year data - Group label should be "Month name" ( January, February .... )
        For older year - "Year" (2019, 2018 ..... )

23. Implement Merge Sort
