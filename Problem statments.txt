1. Sorting Objects based on keys:
    - Basic sorting using quick sort on name key of object
    - Time Complexity: O(n log n)
    
    TO ADD:
    - Handle duplicate name values and then sort on id values
    
2. Print all prime numbers from 1 to 100:
    - Prints all prime numbers based on logic that they are not multiple of any numbers except 1 and itself.
    - Time Complexity : O(n)
    
    TO ADD:
    - Single function to check whather a number if prime or not based on different theorms eg: Fermet's theorem, etc
