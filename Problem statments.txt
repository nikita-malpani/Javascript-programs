1. Sorting Objects based on keys:
    - Basic sorting using quick sort on name key of object
    - Time Complexity: O(n log n)
    
    TO ADD:
    - Handle duplicate name values and then sort on id values
    
2. Print all prime numbers from 1 to 100:
    - Prints all prime numbers based on logic that they are not multiple of any numbers except 1 and itself.
    - Time Complexity : O(n)
    
    TO ADD:
    - Single function to check whather a number if prime or not based on different theorms eg: Fermet's theorem, etc

3. Curring function for multipilcation:
    - Curring : It is a process of turning a function with multiple arity into a function with less arity (number of arguments        a function takes).
    - Based on logic that functions in JS are 1st order objects i.e, they can be assigned to a variable, given as a function         argument and also returned from a function.

4. Check Anagram strings:
    - An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word, typically using all the original         letters exactly once.
    - Based on logic: When 2 strings have same number of letters then their sorted alphabets will be in same order
    
    TO ADD:
    - Different ways of implenetation: Using sets, maps
